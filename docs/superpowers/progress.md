# Progress

The tracker every stage reads first and updates last. One section per cycle; newest first.

### Log

- 2026-11-13: Stage 1. Spec written from the Owner's brainstorm, then updated with the Owner's answers (sign-in on Cloudflare
  Pages, file formats, languages, Android, GitHub-style merges, protected main). Open items are in the spec.
- 2026-11-13: Stage 2. The framework's M1 plan written: 15 tasks, from the repo's skeleton and CI to publishing 0.1.0.
  The sim core and the Rapier integration are lifted from AutomataFrameworkFailed@ed8592e8; the rest is fresh. Stages 2
  to 7 above track this plan; the other three repos' M1 plans are written in their own repos once the Owner creates
  them. The Owner's answers the same day: the npm scope is `@automataframework` (the spec and `CLAUDE.md` still say
  `@automata` and need a follow-up edit); `@types/node` and `@vitest/browser-playwright` are approved; the old repo's
  hosted-runner refusals came from it being private.
